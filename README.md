Code to automatically create decks for the game Stormbound

## the plan
The SBDE(Stormbound Deck Engine) is an artificial intelligence project that creates decks for the game Stormbound. Here's the plan for how it will work.
The engine will take five parameters(more may be added or removed later on):
 - Faction/Factions
 - Rank
 - Average Level
 - Required Cards
 - Archetype

unfortunately this project requires tons of data, and is why I , Nyelsonon am asking for your help!

In my "info" folder you'll find multiple files, look for one called rating.txt. If you ever have the time you can fill the data for a card's rating in a certain league. Then you can keep the level of the card as well. I know this probably sounds confusing so here's and example:

Obsidian Butchers, 75, Diamond, 5

the format for data is:

Card Name, Rating, League, Level

more updates to the README.md file will be added soon
